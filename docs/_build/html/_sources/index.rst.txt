Quantitative analysis of complex static (2D and 3D) and dynamic (4D) images often relies upon several disconnected software packages and/or the use of expensive commercial software packages. We have recently developed a software package for the complete analysis of all types of biological imaging data. The goal of Cecelia is to simplify image analysis for biologists within a single user interface that is built around `R/shiny` and `python/napari`.
